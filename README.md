Web forgery reporter
====================
There are several aspects of the [existing][existing] web forgery reporter that should be changed:

* [Old][logo] Firefox logo is used.
* Website is neither pretty not Mozilla-style.
* [Phishing link][link-old] should be updated to the one it [redirects to][link-new].
* AFAIK this is the only non-localizable site linked from Firefox.

Here is my proposal for the new design:

* The new Firefox logo is used. :-)
* It is based on [Firefox brand toolkit][brand].
* It resembles [Firefox Input][input] (shall we integrate reporter?).
* Phishing link is updated.
* It should be hosted on Mozilla servers (localizable).

Demo of the proposed Web Forgery Reporter can be found [here][demo].
